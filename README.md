# Advent of Code 2025

For public curiosity's sake, here are my solutions to the programming challenges from [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Some Notes

For the most part, I used Python with standard libraries. Exceptions include:

- Day 10, for which I was unable to get a branch-bound solution to run fast enough and fell back on SciPy. I've included both my not-efficient-enough solution and the SciPy alternative.
- Day 12, which didn't require a programming solution. For this problem, I just pulled data into a spreadsheet and counted the number of 3x3 grid spaces that could fit each problem item.
